# Portfolio Landing Page

It was a study project on [RSSchool Stage0](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) course.
The project included 3 stages:
1. Create fixed layout. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/portfolio/portfolio-part1.md)<br>
2. Add adaptive on screens 320...768px and 768px...and more. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/portfolio/portfolio-part2.md)<br>
3. Add interactives with JavaScript (gallery, video, change mode, change language etc). Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/portfolio/portfolio-part3.md)<br>

Common solution took about 7 days. In [the result](https://pesukarhutg.github.io/portfolio/) you can see a nice adaptive landing page<br><br>
